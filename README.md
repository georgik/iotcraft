# IoTCraft

IoTCraft is a multi-component Rust project showcasing MQTT-controlled IoT devices and a desktop 3D visualizer with dynamic device positioning and persistent device management.

![IoTCraft Desktop Client](docs/images/iotcraft-deskto-client.webp)

## Components

- **desktop-client**  
  A Rust **std** application built with Bevy. It renders a 3D scene containing:
  - **Luanti-like voxel world** with individual 1x1x1 blocks
  - **Block manipulation system** - place, remove, and manage different block types (grass, dirt, stone)
  - **World persistence** - save and load entire voxel worlds to/from JSON files
  - **Script system** - automate building with command scripts
  - Dynamic device spawning based on MQTT announcements
  - Interactive device control via mouse clicks (lamps: ON/OFF, doors: open/close via MQTT)
  - Drag-and-drop device positioning with persistent storage
  - **Door system** - 3D doors that rotate 90 degrees when opened/closed
  - **Comprehensive console interface** for world and device management
  - **Real-time diagnostics overlay** - Press F3 for detailed debug information
  - A rotating logo cube and thermometer indicator
  - **Enhanced WASD + mouse camera controls** (fixed Luanti-like movement)
  - **Enhanced inventory system** - 9-slot hotbar with item management
  - Comprehensive MQTT logging and diagnostics

- **mqtt-server**  
  A Rust **std** executable using `rumqttd` as an embedded MQTT broker.  
  Reads `rumqttd.toml` for configuration and handles MQTT v4/v5 and WebSocket connections.

- **mqtt-client**  
  A Rust **std** command-line tool using `rumqttc` for synchronous publish/subscribe.  
  Examples:
  ```bash
  # Subscribe to lamp topic
  mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 1883 -t home/cube/light -i mqtt-client
  
  # Publish ON/OFF
  mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 -t home/cube/light -m "ON" -i mqtt-client
  ```

- **esp32-c6-client**  
  An embedded **no_std** application for the ESP32-C6 using Embassy and ESP HAL.  
  - Connects to Wi-Fi, announces itself via MQTT (`devices/announce` topic) with a unique device ID using random suffix
  - Subscribes to device-specific lamp control topic (`home/{device_id}/light`) and toggles an LED
  - Listens for position updates on `home/{device_id}/position/set` and stores coordinates persistently
  - Reads the on-board temperature sensor via I2C and publishes readings (`home/sensor/temperature`)
  - Uses NVS (Non-Volatile Storage) to persist device properties between reboots

- **esp32-c3-devkit-rust-1**  
  An embedded **no_std** application for the ESP32-C3-DevKit-RS board using Embassy.  
  Similar to the C6 client but adapted to the C3‚Äôs GPIO layout and peripherals.

## Getting Started

### Desktop Client

```bash
# Ensure MQTT broker is running:
cd mqtt-server
cargo run

# Run the Bevy 3D visualizer:
cd desktop-client
cargo run

# Run with a specific language (optional):
# Supported languages: en-US, de-DE, cs-CZ, bg-BG, es-ES, fr-FR, hr-HR, hu-HU, it-IT, ja-JP, pl-PL, pt-BR, ro-RO, sk-SK, sl-SI, zh-CN
cargo run -- --lang=de-DE  # German
cargo run -- --lang=cs-CZ  # Czech
```

### MQTT Server

```bash
cd mqtt-server
cargo run
```

### MQTT Client

```bash
cd mqtt-client
cargo run
```

### ESP32 Clients

Set Wi-Fi SSID/PASSWORD and broker address in the embedded source, then flash:

```bash
export SSID="your_wifi_ssid"
export PASSWORD="your_wifi_password"
export SERVER_IP="your_mqtt_broker_ip"
# ESP32-C6
cd esp32-c6-client
cargo run --release

# ESP32-C3-DevKit
cd esp32-c3-devkit-rust-1
cargo run --release
```

#### Simulation

Use Wokwi simulator ([wokwi-cli](https://docs.wokwi.com/wokwi-ci/cli-usage), 
[JetBrains plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/23826-wokwi-simulator) or 
[VS Code plugin](https://docs.wokwi.com/vscode/getting-started)) to simulate ESP32-C3 device.

```bash
export SSID="Wokwi-GUEST"
export PASSWORD=""
export SERVER_IP="your_mqtt_broker_ip"

cd esp32-c3-devkit-rust-1
cargo build --release
wokwi-cli
```

## Device Registration System

The IoTCraft system now supports dynamic device registration:

1. **ESP32 devices** automatically announce themselves when they connect to Wi-Fi
2. **Desktop client** listens for device announcements and automatically spawns 3D representations
3. **Interactive control** allows clicking on devices in the 3D world to control them
4. **Dynamic topics** use device-specific MQTT topics (`home/{device_id}/light`)

### Device Announcement Format

Devices announce themselves using this JSON format on the `devices/announce` topic:
```json
{
  "device_id": "esp32c6_aabbcc112233",
  "device_type": "lamp", 
  "state": "online",
  "location": { "x": 1.0, "y": 0.5, "z": 2.0 }
}
```

**Supported Device Types:**
- `lamp` - Cubic devices that can be toggled ON/OFF (change color and emit light)
- `door` - Tall, thin rectangular devices (0.2 x 2.0 x 1.0) that rotate 90¬∞ when opened/closed

### MQTT Topics

- `devices/announce` - Device registration announcements
- `home/{device_id}/light` - Individual device lamp control  
- `home/{device_id}/position/set` - Device position updates (JSON with x, y, z coordinates)
- `home/sensor/temperature` - Temperature sensor readings

### Testing with Real Devices

To test with an ESP32-C6 device:

1. Flash the ESP32-C6 client code
2. Start the MQTT server and desktop client  
3. The ESP32 will automatically appear in the 3D world when it connects
4. Click on the device cube to toggle its LED on/off
5. Use the "blink" console command to make all registered devices blink
