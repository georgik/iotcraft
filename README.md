# IoTCraft

IoTCraft is a multi-component Rust project showcasing MQTT-controlled IoT devices and a desktop 3D visualizer with dynamic device positioning and persistent device management.

![IoTCraft Desktop Client](docs/images/iotcraft-deskto-client.webp)

## Components

- **desktop-client**  
  A Rust **std** application built with Bevy. It renders a 3D scene containing:
  - Dynamic device spawning based on MQTT announcements
  - Interactive device control via mouse clicks (ON/OFF via MQTT)
  - Drag-and-drop device positioning with persistent storage
  - Console commands for device management (`move`, `blink`, `spawn`)
  - A textured grass ground and sky
  - A rotating logo cube
  - A thermometer indicator scaling with temperature readings
  - WASD + mouse camera controls
  - Comprehensive MQTT logging and diagnostics

- **mqtt-server**  
  A Rust **std** executable using `rumqttd` as an embedded MQTT broker.  
  Reads `rumqttd.toml` for configuration and handles MQTT v4/v5 and WebSocket connections.

- **mqtt-client**  
  A Rust **std** command-line tool using `rumqttc` for synchronous publish/subscribe.  
  Examples:
  ```bash
  # Subscribe to lamp topic
  mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 1883 -t home/cube/light -i mqtt-client
  
  # Publish ON/OFF
  mosquitto_pub -h localhost -p 1883 -t home/cube/light -m "ON" -i mqtt-client
  ```

- **esp32-c6-client**  
  An embedded **no_std** application for the ESP32-C6 using Embassy and ESP HAL.  
  - Connects to Wi-Fi, announces itself via MQTT (`devices/announce` topic) with a unique device ID using random suffix
  - Subscribes to device-specific lamp control topic (`home/{device_id}/light`) and toggles an LED
  - Listens for position updates on `home/{device_id}/position/set` and stores coordinates persistently
  - Reads the on-board temperature sensor via I2C and publishes readings (`home/sensor/temperature`)
  - Uses NVS (Non-Volatile Storage) to persist device properties between reboots

- **esp32-c3-devkit-rust-1**  
  An embedded **no_std** application for the ESP32-C3-DevKit-RS board using Embassy.  
  Similar to the C6 client but adapted to the C3‚Äôs GPIO layout and peripherals.

## Getting Started

### Desktop Client

```bash
# Ensure MQTT broker is running:
cd mqtt-server
cargo run

# Run the Bevy 3D visualizer:
cd desktop-client
cargo run
```

### MQTT Server

```bash
cd mqtt-server
cargo run
```

### MQTT Client

```bash
cd mqtt-client
cargo run
```

### ESP32 Clients

Set Wi-Fi SSID/PASSWORD and broker address in the embedded source, then flash:

```bash
export SSID="your_wifi_ssid"
export PASSWORD="your_wifi_password"
export SERVER_IP="your_mqtt_broker_ip"
# ESP32-C6
cd esp32-c6-client
cargo run --release

# ESP32-C3-DevKit
cd esp32-c3-devkit-rust-1
cargo run --release
```

#### Simulation

Use Wokwi simulator ([wokwi-cli](https://docs.wokwi.com/wokwi-ci/cli-usage), 
[JetBrains plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/23826-wokwi-simulator) or 
[VS Code plugin](https://docs.wokwi.com/vscode/getting-started)) to simulate ESP32-C3 device.

```bash
export SSID="Wokwi-GUEST"
export PASSWORD=""
export SERVER_IP="your_mqtt_broker_ip"

cd esp32-c3-devkit-rust-1
cargo build --release
wokwi-cli
```

## Device Registration System

The IoTCraft system now supports dynamic device registration:

1. **ESP32 devices** automatically announce themselves when they connect to Wi-Fi
2. **Desktop client** listens for device announcements and automatically spawns 3D representations
3. **Interactive control** allows clicking on devices in the 3D world to control them
4. **Dynamic topics** use device-specific MQTT topics (`home/{device_id}/light`)

### Device Announcement Format

Devices announce themselves using this JSON format on the `devices/announce` topic:
```json
{
  "device_id": "esp32c6_aabbcc112233",
  "device_type": "lamp", 
  "state": "online",
  "location": { "x": 1.0, "y": 0.5, "z": 2.0 }
}
```

### MQTT Topics

- `devices/announce` - Device registration announcements
- `home/{device_id}/light` - Individual device lamp control  
- `home/{device_id}/position/set` - Device position updates (JSON with x, y, z coordinates)
- `home/sensor/temperature` - Temperature sensor readings

### Testing with Real Devices

To test with an ESP32-C6 device:

1. Flash the ESP32-C6 client code
2. Start the MQTT server and desktop client  
3. The ESP32 will automatically appear in the 3D world when it connects
4. Click on the device cube to toggle its LED on/off
5. Use the "blink" console command to make all registered devices blink

## New Features

### üéØ Dynamic Device Positioning

**Drag and Drop Interface:**
- Click and drag any device in the 3D world to reposition it
- Devices can be moved freely on the ground plane
- Position updates are sent via MQTT to the physical device
- Supports real-time positioning of multiple devices

**Console Commands:**
- `move <device_id> <x> <y> <z>` - Move a device to specific coordinates
- `blink` - Make all registered devices blink their LEDs
- `spawn` - Manually spawn a device for testing

### üíæ Persistent Device Properties

**ESP32 Device Storage:**
- Device positions are stored persistently using NVS (Non-Volatile Storage)
- Coordinates survive device reboots and power cycles
- Automatic loading of stored position on startup
- Device announcements include current stored coordinates

**Position Update Flow:**
1. User drags device in desktop client
2. MQTT message sent to `home/{device_id}/position/set`
3. ESP32 device receives and parses JSON coordinates
4. New coordinates saved to persistent storage
5. Device uses stored position in next announcement

### üîß MQTT Configuration Management

**Environment-Based Configuration:**
```bash
# Configure MQTT broker for desktop client
export MQTT_HOST="your-broker-hostname"
export MQTT_PORT="1883"
```

**Features:**
- Centralized MQTT configuration via environment variables
- Defaults to localhost:1883 if not specified
- Consistent broker settings across all MQTT operations
- Support for different broker configurations per environment

### üîç Enhanced MQTT Diagnostics

**Comprehensive Logging:**
- Detailed MQTT connection status logging
- Message publish/subscribe tracing
- Device announcement and registration logging
- Position update message logging
- Connection error diagnostics

**Debug Information:**
- Real-time MQTT message flow visibility
- Device state change tracking
- Network connectivity status
- Topic subscription confirmations

### üÜî Unique Device Identification

**Random Device IDs:**
- ESP32 devices generate unique IDs using random suffixes
- Format: `esp32c6_<random_suffix>` (e.g., `esp32c6_aabbcc112233`)
- Prevents device ID conflicts in multi-device deployments
- Consistent ID across device reboots

### üèóÔ∏è Improved Architecture

**Plugin-Based System:**
- `MqttPlugin` - Centralized MQTT connection management
- `DevicePlugin` - Device spawning and lifecycle management
- `DevicePositioningPlugin` - Drag-and-drop positioning system
- Modular, maintainable codebase structure

**Resource Management:**
- `DevicesTracker` - Tracks spawned devices and their states
- `MqttConfig` - Centralized configuration management
- `DragState` - Mouse interaction state management
- Clean separation of concerns between systems

### üì° MQTT Topic Architecture

**Device-Specific Topics:**
- `devices/announce` - Device registration and heartbeat
- `home/{device_id}/light` - Individual lamp control (ON/OFF)
- `home/{device_id}/position/set` - Position updates (JSON coordinates)
- `home/sensor/temperature` - Temperature sensor readings

**Message Formats:**
```json
// Device announcement
{
  "device_id": "esp32c6_aabbcc112233",
  "device_type": "lamp",
  "state": "online",
  "location": { "x": 1.0, "y": 0.5, "z": 2.0 }
}

// Position update
{
  "x": 2.5,
  "y": 0.5,
  "z": -1.0
}
```
